# Detection of racism, sexism and hate speech in tweets with transformer-based models

Racism and Sexism are two sub-categories of Hate Speech. Racism, Sexism, and Hate Speech detection in a general sense are all problems that have been studied and revisited multiple times. In this work we try a new approach not studied before. We study the generalization of hate speech detection models. <b>Can a transformer-based general hate speech detection model perform as well as racism and sexism focused detection models on racism and sexism datasets?</b>. No.

This repository is split into multiple sections containing the code used for implementation.
